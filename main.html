    <h1>Code Optimization</h1>
    <p>Code optimization aims to improve the efficiency of a program by reducing the time taken to run it and increasing the space occupied. Here are some techniques:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Algorithm Optimization:</strong> Choose the most efficient algorithms and data structures for the problem. Well-designed algorithms can significantly reduce execution time and memory usage.</li>

    <h1>Code Optimization</h1>
    <p>Code optimization aims to improve the efficiency of a program by reducing memory usage and, in some cases, increasing its total run time. Here are some techniques:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Use efficient memory management techniques to minimize memory consumption. Proper allocation and deallocation of memory can reduce the overall memory footprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce Data Structures:</strong> Choose data structures that require less memory for storage. For instance, using bit arrays instead of arrays of booleans can save memory.</li>
        <li><strong>Lazy Loading:</strong> Load data into memory only when it's needed, instead of loading everything at the beginning. Lazy loading can reduce the initial memory requirement.</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming and Pipelining:</strong> Process data in chunks or streams instead of loading the entire dataset into memory. This can lower memory usage at the expense of increased runtime due to data processing overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Compiler Optimization:</strong> Enable compiler optimizations that may lead to more efficient memory usage. Some optimizations can reduce the memory requirements of the generated code.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Trade-offs:</strong> Sometimes, using memory-intensive algorithms can lead to faster execution time. Consider algorithmic trade-offs between memory and speed based on your specific use case.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Compressed Data Structures:</strong> Utilize compressed data structures to reduce memory usage while processing data. Compression techniques can save memory at the cost of increased processing time.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Memory Allocation:</strong> Minimize dynamic memory allocation during runtime, as frequent allocation and deallocation can lead to memory fragmentation and inefficiencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Minimization:</strong> Eliminate unnecessary code, comments, and unused variables to reduce memory usage. Smaller code size can lead to lower memory requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Pointers and References:</strong> Instead of duplicating data, use pointers or references to share the same memory location, reducing the memory overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Pruning:</strong> Remove unnecessary or redundant data from memory during program execution to free up memory resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Trade Memory for Time:</strong> In certain cases, using more memory can lead to faster execution. Consider trading off memory usage for speed or vice versa, based on your program's requirements.</li>

    <h1>Code Optimization - Deploying Relevant Algorithms</h1>
    <p>Code optimization involves the strategic use of algorithms to reduce both time and space complexity. By selecting appropriate algorithms, we can significantly improve the efficiency of a program. Here are some techniques:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Choose Efficient Algorithms:</strong> Select algorithms known for their lower time complexity, such as O(log n) or O(n*log n), over those with higher time complexity, like O(n^2). This choice can lead to faster execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize Data Structures:</strong> Use data structures that are well-suited for the specific operations performed by the program. For example, hash tables for fast key-value lookups or priority queues for efficient access to the minimum or maximum element.</li>
        <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems and solve them independently. This approach often reduces time complexity and enables parallel processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Greedy Algorithms:</strong> Utilize greedy algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step. Although they may not always provide globally optimal solutions, they can be faster and simpler for certain problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Apply dynamic programming to efficiently solve problems with overlapping subproblems. It reduces redundant calculations and improves time complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Binary Search:</strong> Use binary search for sorted datasets to quickly find elements, significantly reducing the time complexity compared to linear search.</li>
        <li><strong>Memoization:</strong> Cache and reuse the results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations, reducing time complexity for recursive algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Sliding Window Technique:</strong> Optimize problems involving arrays or strings by using a sliding window to efficiently traverse and process the data in linear time.</li>
        <li><strong>Bit Manipulation:</strong> Employ bitwise operations for certain tasks to optimize memory usage and reduce time complexity.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Algorithms:</strong> Utilize parallel algorithms and multi-threading to distribute the workload across multiple cores, improving overall execution time.</li>
        <li><strong>Approximation Algorithms:</strong> Consider using approximation algorithms to quickly find solutions that are close to the optimal ones, which can be computationally expensive to obtain.</li>
        <li><strong>Randomized Algorithms:</strong> Use randomized algorithms to introduce randomness and decrease the likelihood of worst-case scenarios, leading to improved average-case performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Consider trade-offs between time and space complexity. Sometimes, optimizing one may impact the other, so finding the right balance is essential.</li>
